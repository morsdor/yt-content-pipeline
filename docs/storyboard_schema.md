# The Storyboard JSON Schema

## Field Reference

> **Two-pass storyboard.** The storyboard is built in two passes so you lock the *story* before any visual prompts are written:
> - **Pass 1 — Narrative** (what you review first): the structural/story fields only. No generation prompts.
> - **Pass 2 — Generation** (added *after* you approve Pass 1): the image/animation prompts and file paths.
>
> The `Pass` column below shows when each field appears. The assembler ignores the prompt fields (`image_prompt`, `animation_prompt`) — they're instructions for the image/animation steps, not for assembly.
>
> *(Note: the `the-engineering-atlas-video` skill currently writes the storyboard in a single fully-populated pass with lean per-scene fields — the field semantics below are identical either way.)*

| Field | Pass | Type | Required | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `type` | 1 | string | ✅ | `"animated"` or `"static"` |
| `duration` | 1 | number | ✅ | Scene duration in seconds. **Animated: default 6s.** Duration is the main Kling cost lever — a 10s clip costs ~2× a 6s one, and the 6s bias is what keeps 2 videos/month inside the 3,000-credit Pro plan ([costs.md](costs.md)). Only go 8–10s when the motion genuinely needs the extra time. **Static (Ken Burns): 10–15s.** Any animated scene that fails the accuracy gate twice falls back to `type:"static"` Ken Burns (accurate by construction, free). |
| `scene_type` | 1 | string | ❌ | `establishing`, `cross_section`, `map`, `detail`, `scale_comparison` |
| `motion` | 1 | string | ❌ | Ken Burns motion for static scenes: `zoom_in`, `zoom_out`, `pan_left`, `pan_right`, `pan_up`, `zoom_detail` |
| `focus_x`, `focus_y` | 1 | number | ❌ | For `zoom_detail` only (0.0–1.0, default center) |
| `texts` | 1 | array | ❌ | Array of text objects: `[{"text": "...", "start": 2, "end": 6, "position": "bottom"}]`. Set to `[]` for no text |
| `narration_segment` | 1 | string | ❌ | Narration text for this scene (reference only) |
| `visual_facts` | 1 | array | ❌ | Must-be-true *visually checkable* claims for this scene, drawn from `references/visual_facts.md` (e.g. `"steps descend in paired V-flights"`). Injected into the image AND animation prompts by `prompt_builder.py`, and doubles as the accuracy checklist at the validation gate. Write these in Pass 1 — they're facts, not prompts. |
| `reference_image` | 2 | string | ❌ | Path to a real photo in `references/` for this scene. `generate_images.py` passes it alongside the style anchor (anchor = LOOK, reference = GEOMETRY) and it's the comparison image at the validation gate. Use for scenes depicting real, verifiable structures; omit for abstract diagrams/maps. |
| `image_prompt` | 2 | string | ❌ | Full still-image prompt (style card + subject + accent + composition). Added after Pass 1 approval. |
| `image` | 2 | string | ✅* | Relative path to the generated scene image (*required at assembly time) |
| `animation_prompt` | 2 | string | ❌ | Prompt for Kling AI (used during the animation step) |
| `animated_clip` | 2 | string | ❌ | Path to AI-animated clip (required when type=animated, at assembly time) |
| `particle_overlay` | 2 | string | ❌ | Path to particle overlay clip (dust, sparks, rain) |
