/**
 * Depth First — brand tokens.  Source of truth for `brand_guide_software.md` §3/§4/§5.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE USING: these are the SPEC and the VALIDATOR, not runtime imports.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Remotion Studio can only make a style interactive — click-to-select, drag, editable
 * keyframes, edits written back to code — when every value in the `style` prop is an
 * INLINE LITERAL.  Referring to a constant (`color: COLORS.amber`) greys the control out
 * and silently costs us the exact capability the pipeline was chosen for
 * (`/remotion-interactivity`; brand guide §11; remotion-director Rule 7).
 *
 * So the doctrine is:
 *   • Scene + family files carry HARDCODED LITERALS in `style`.  Studio stays live.
 *   • This file is where those literals are DEFINED, documented and version-controlled.
 *   • `npm run brand:check` scans the scene files and fails on any colour or easing
 *     curve that isn't in here.
 *
 * Enforcement therefore happens at lint time rather than import time — which is strictly
 * better, because a lint catches drift that has already been written, while an import
 * only prevents it at the cost of interactivity.
 *
 * Import these tokens freely OUTSIDE of interactive `style` props: `<Composition>`
 * metadata, `defaultProps`, `calculateMetadata()`, plain non-interactive wrappers, and
 * the check script.

 * C=0.028, slate C=0.023 in OKLCH) which is what made short-form frames read as
 * pale: measured on real reel frames, ~90% of every frame was effectively
 * greyscale and under 2% was vivid. They now carry real chroma at the same
 * lightness, so the frame is coloured without a single element being added.
