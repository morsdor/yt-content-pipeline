## Operating assumptions (the decisions that shape everything)

**Revised July 13, 2026 — the studio pivot (direction-first pre-production):**
- **The pipeline is a studio, not a prompt chain.** A finished script enters the seven-pass **studio chain** (`studio-director` skill): script-analyzer → film-director → storyboard-artist → scene-composer → asset-planner → motion-director → ae-director. Each pass fills its block in **one accreting `storyboard.json` (schema v2)** — the production document — mirrored by a readable `shot_list.md`. → [docs/storyboard_schema.md](docs/storyboard_schema.md)
- **Image generation is a derived step, not an independent one.** What gets generated (plates, library assets) falls out of the scene-composer's build decisions (`plate` / `assembly` / `plate+layers`) and the asset-planner's batch. Nothing is prompted ad hoc.
- **60–80 scenes × 8–12s**, timestamped to the script; **VO is recorded before the AE build** ("animate to track") and scene timings are trued-up to the real read; AE renders carry ~1s handles.
- **Final conform in Premiere Pro** (clips + VO + music, trim-only); `video_assembler.py` is now the **animatic** tool — a stills+VO rough cut that fixes pacing in the board before AE hours are spent.
- **Two knowledge canons drive every pass:** [docs/cinematography.md](docs/cinematography.md) (craft: shot grammar, rhythm, staging, continuity — rules cited by ID) and `brand_guide.md` §5 **Motion Identity** (the numeric motion limits).

**Revised July 12, 2026 — the animation pivot:**
- **Motion is hand-built in After Effects from AI stills.** Generative image-to-video was dropped after measurement: it softens crisp lines, warps precise geometry, and adds uninvited camera moves on our flat isometric style (~70% of a full batch failed the quality bar). AE transforms the art but never redraws it — sharp by construction. → [docs/after_effects_workflow.md](docs/after_effects_workflow.md)
- **A reusable cross-video asset library** (`assets_library/` — characters, nature, architecture, military, props, diagram elements) feeds AE. AI generates the assets; `STYLE_BIBLE.md` locks the look; `INDEX.md` tracks what exists so nothing is generated twice. Assets compound: video 1 needs ~40, video 10 needs ~5.
- **AI's three levers in AE:** (1) generating assets, (2) directing — the studio passes that fill each scene's numeric motion + build blocks, (3) writing AE expressions and JSX scripts (`ae_scripts/`) that build comps programmatically.
- **Animation is now free at the margin** — no per-clip credits, no charged retries. The budget shifted from credits to *your AE time*, controlled by templates and the three-rung ladder (camera moves → parallax → element motion).

**Revised July 6, 2026** (see `strategy_review.md`):
- **Cadence: 2 videos/month**, not 8 — quality over volume, sustainable alongside a full-time job.
- **Narration is your own recorded voice** from day 1; the AI clone is a pickup-only fallback.
- **Two mandatory human steps:** a real fact-check pass, and the "Altered content" disclosure on upload — these keep the channel monetizable under YouTube's 2026 inauthentic-content policy.
- **Graceful degradation:** any scene not worth AE time simplifies to its Rung-1 camera-only build (validated plate + eased push). You always ship.

**Corrected July 10, 2026** (second review):
- **Visual accuracy is a gated step:** per-project `references/` pack + `visual_facts`, injected into prompts; **no still is animated unvalidated** → [`visual-accuracy-gate` skill](visual-accuracy-gate/SKILL.md).
- **Time per video: ~8–12 hrs** (16–24 hrs/month) → [docs/production_workflow.md](docs/production_workflow.md).
- **Thumbnails are a first-class session** (packaging-first gate, 3 candidates, Test & Compare) → Session 5b in the workflow.

## The skills (agent-executed procedures)

| Skill | What it does | Invoked when |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [`the-engineering-atlas-video`](the-engineering-atlas-video/SKILL.md) | The full per-video production checklist with human gates (research → script → studio → VO → generate → animatic → AE → conform → publish) | "Start a new video…" (see `new_video_prompt_template.md`) |
| [`studio-director`](studio-director/SKILL.md) | **The pre-production orchestrator** — runs the seven passes below on one storyboard.json v2, enforces gates + pass order, `--validate` between passes | Script approved — "board this script" |
| `script-analyzer` → `film-director` → `storyboard-artist` → `scene-composer` → `asset-planner` → `motion-director` → `ae-director` | The seven studio passes: segmentation+timestamps → shots+sequence → frames → builds+layers → asset sourcing → numeric motion → AE blueprints+JSX. Each fills its block; each SKILL.md carries its role's craft | In order, via studio-director (each also invocable solo for rework) |
| [`art-director`](art-director/SKILL.md) | Keeper of the bibles — motif kits per civilization, style rulings, consolidation. Consulted, not sequential | New civilization/territory; style questions; drift |
| [`asset-generation`](asset-generation/SKILL.md) | Executes the board: plates from `plate{}` blocks → accuracy gate → approved batch → asset gate → 4K prep → render QC when AE clips land | Board approved — "generate the assets" |
| [`visual-accuracy-gate`](visual-accuracy-gate/SKILL.md) | Layer 2 plates vs references/facts · Layer 2.5 assets · Layer 3 renders (motion craft + **continuity registry** + **comprehension QA**); delta-prompt fixes; "no unvalidated plate is animated" | Mandatory gates inside generation, and after AE renders land |
| [`thumbnail-workflow`](thumbnail-workflow/SKILL.md) | Packaging-first gate → 3 candidates (one axis varied) → 120-px squint test → local typography → Test & Compare → `thumbnails_log.md` | At script approval (gate), and publish (production) |

> **Skills work in both environments:** claude.ai co-work picks them up from these root-level folders when the project folder is connected; Claude Code discovers the same skills via symlinks in `.claude/skills/`. One source of truth, two runtimes.

## The one-paragraph version

Research and fact-check yourself (incl. the reference pack) → your approved script enters the **studio chain** (`studio-director`): seven passes turn it into one `storyboard.json` v2 — 60–80 timestamped scenes with shots, frames, plate/assembly builds, sourced assets, numeric motion, and AE blueprints (three human gates; packaging-first thumbnail gate at the script) → **record your own narration** and true-up timings to the real read → generation *derived from the board*: `generate_images.py` plates (**accuracy gate: no unvalidated plate proceeds**) + `generate_asset.py` approved batch (asset gate) → `video_assembler.py` cuts the **animatic** (fix pacing in the board, not in AE) → **you build every scene in After Effects** per its blueprint (JSX scaffolds do the setup; transforms only, so the art stays sharp; ~1s handles) → Layer 3 render QC (craft + continuity + comprehension) → **conform in Premiere Pro** (clips on the VO, cuts on narration beats, 4K master) → 3 thumbnails + Test & Compare → full watch, "Altered content" disclosure, publish. **~₹500–750 marginal cash + ~10–14 hrs per video; ~₹5,000/month all-in (Claude + Adobe + images) at 2 videos/month.**

*Last updated: July 13, 2026 — the studio pivot: direction-first pre-production (seven-pass studio chain on one storyboard.json v2), image generation now derived, VO before build, Premiere Pro conform, video_assembler repurposed as the animatic. Previous revisions: July 12 (animation pivot — generative i2v removed, AE hand-built motion), July 10 (visual accuracy, thumbnails, corrected budget + hours), July 6 (2/month cadence, self-narration, fact-check + disclosure gates — see `strategy_review.md`).*
